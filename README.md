# speech-to-text

This REST API accepts a sound file and compares it with the text "This is my family. I live in a city." The API uses Node.js for the backend and OpenAI's Whisper API to transcribe the audio file. The accuracy of the transcription is then calculated using the Word Error Rate (WER) library, which is a measure of the edit distance between two texts.
